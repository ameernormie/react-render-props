This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What I learned

    1- How render props work in React.
    2- How to render different UI based on same state.
    3- Use 'childern' to render.
    4- Pass 'state' to 'render' method.
    5- Access 'state' in callback render method.

### `npm start`
